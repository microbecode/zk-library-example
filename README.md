# zk-library-example

An example project utilizing a ZK Bellman library

This project is for making sure that a prover knows a preimage that produces a SHA256 hash with enough leading zeros. The amount of leading zeros required is configurable.

The code is based on example from https://docs.rs/bellman/0.14.0/bellman/index.html .
